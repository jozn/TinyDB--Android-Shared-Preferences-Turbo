# Static TinyDB Wrapper around Android-Shared-Preferences

This class simplifies calls to SharedPreferences in a line of code. It can also do more like: saving a list of strings, integers and saving images. All in 1 line of code!

This class is a fork of https://github.com/kcochibili/TinyDB--Android-Shared-Preferences-Turbo with changed methods to statics.
